This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Resolving Git Push Error

If you encounter a permission error when pushing to the repository, follow these steps:

1. Check your remote URL:
   ```sh
   git remote -v
   ```

2. If the remote URL is correct and you still face issues, try removing and re-adding the remote:
   ```sh
   git remote remove origin
   git remote add origin https://github.com/371931/cousinscharms.git
   ```

3. Ensure you have the correct permissions to push to the repository. If you are not the owner, request access from the repository owner.

4. If you have two-factor authentication enabled, use a personal access token instead of your password when prompted.

5. Finally, try pushing your changes again:
   ```sh
   git push -u origin main
   ```
